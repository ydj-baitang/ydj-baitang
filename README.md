### I'm 小白

🔭 Security operations, focusing on ensuring the stability and security of systems.
🌱 Learning network security to gain a deeper understanding of defensive and 
response strategies in the field.

👯 Looking to collaborate with professionals in network security to explore
and discuss the latest trends and technologies.

🤔 Seeking help with gaining more hands-on experience in network security, as
I have practical experience in Linux and MySQL. I would appreciate guidance and 
shared experiences to better combine theory with practice.

topics.

📫 Reach me via email at [480603842@qq.com]. I look forward to connecting and 
collaborating with you.

😄 Pronouns: I use “Optimistic” as my pronoun.

⚡ Fun fact: Besides my technical interests, I’m passionate about traveling and 
photography, enjoying the beauty of the world in my free time.
